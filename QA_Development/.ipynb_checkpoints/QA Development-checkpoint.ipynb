    "Things to Check:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1) Number of entries in all non-empty tables [excluding government_organization and wipo_fields] is within 10% of what it was last time and is greater than the number last time. Instead of writing a ton of separate functions figure out (1) how to get a list of table from the database. (2) write one function that takes in a table name as an argument and then runs the equality check on that table (you can modify the check_patent function we wrote) and (3) iterate over the tables and apply this function to each of the tables. \n",
    " \n",
    " 2) The ratio of distinct ids to total ids is with in .1 of what it was last time for each table. For example, the ratio of [select count(distinct id) from patent] divided by [select count(id) from patent] is close to the same ratio from last year. The id column is often patent_id, but in other tables it is not, if you can't tell just ask. Probably you will want to end up with a similar function to the function above that will use a dictionary to map each table name to the id column you've identified. \n",
    " \n",
    " 2) The distribution of patents across patent type and patent kind are similar to how they were last time.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3) The latest date in the patent table is the expected final date (in this case 2017-10-03).\n",
    " \n",
    " 4) The count of null and blank values for all columns in all tables is within 10% of last year. Follow a methodolgy similar to in step 1.\n"
